## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-vision-classifier.git
   cd ai-vision-classifier
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the application

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image**
   - Drag and drop an image onto the upload area, or
   - Click the upload area to browse and select an image

2. **Classify the Image**
   - Click the "Classify with AI" button
   - Wait for the AI to process your image (usually under 2 seconds)

3. **View Results**
   - See the top 5 predictions with confidence scores
   - Each prediction shows a confidence bar and percentage
   - Results are ranked by confidence level

## Supported Image Formats

- PNG
- JPG/JPEG
- Maximum file size: 10MB

## API Endpoints
